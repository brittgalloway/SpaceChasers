# Space Chasers: Project 1

 SPACE CHASERS is a web application that allows users in the USA to quickly know if they are able to find and view an Aurora. The user inputs a zip code and the app finds the the nearest registered Dark Sky Places via the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA).

## CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
UI/UX

## TOOLS:
HTML, CSS, Materialize, Leaflet, Javascript

## FEATURES: 
Fully Mobile Responsive

## ADDITIONAL FEATURE: 
Keeps track of current users via Firebase

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: 
As of 10/5/2019 Leaflet was used to help us find coordinates, but the map doesn't have the functionality we were hoping for. For now, if you click on the marker on the map, you will be taken to Google Maps to get driving directions to the location. In the future the map on the page would show the route, and written driving instructions may populate somewhere on the page.

*Note: There are 2 deployed projects. The solar cycle is low for the next few years and the live project should tell you there is nothing to see in the USA. The 2nd link has a lower threshold that allows the user to get information for demonstration purposes.
